# PDF_Summerizer
This project provides a comprehensive solution for summarizing research PDFs using open-source tools. It leverages the power of Hugging Face's gemma model for summarization, along with other state-of-the-art libraries for PDF processing, text chunking, and vector database management.

Key Features

Effective Summarization: Summarizes research PDFs using the pre-trained gemma model from Hugging Face, known for its ability to capture key information and generate concise summaries.
Robust PDF Handling: Employs robust PDF processing techniques (potentially using libraries like PyPDF2 or Camelot) to extract text accurately, even from complex layouts.
Intelligent Chunking: Breaks down the extracted text into meaningful chunks using techniques like sentence segmentation or topic segmentation (potentially using libraries like spaCy or NLTK). This facilitates better summarization by providing context to the gemma model.
Efficient Vector Database: Utilizes Pinecone as a vector database to store and retrieve the encoded representations (embeddings) of text chunks, enabling efficient retrieval of similar summaries for future reference.
Instruct Embeddings (Optional): If applicable, explain the use of Hugging Face's Instruct embeddings to further enhance summarization or information retrieval by providing task-specific guidance to the model.
